# Analytics snippet

Snippet to embed Google Analytics tracking in your application.

## Version

1.0.1

## Installation

It's fairly straightforward. 

1. Pull down the repo
2. Include the main `~/analytics.php` file on every page that requires tracking. 

## Roadmap

I'm hoping to get a little creative with this as really, there's no need for this repo. You could just embed the snippet supplied in Google Analytics, I think it was originally meant to make a little easier so that you only require the UAID.

My plan is to do something like try and pull the latest analytics snippet from Google and inject the UAID directly into a generated file which can then be included - or something like that. Just ideas!
